#black background

"You don't exactly know how you got here. There's a void in your head."
"But you can still remember who you are, and what you're doing here."
"You are a game developer at a very prominent game studio, and you used your savings to take a trip with your friends to England, where you live."
"You are all fans of horror stories and board games, and there are a couple of Narrative Designers in the group..."
"... who, when they saw Innsmouth's name on the map, got curious."
"They let you know that Innsmouth is the fictional name of an American town in one of Lovecraft's stories."
"You were passing through anyway and the sun was setting. So you decided that spending a night in Innsmouth would be thrilling."
"But the rest, as soon as you crossed the border of that eerie little town ... is hazy, in your memories."

#BACKGROUND of outer mansion
#SOUND of leaves blowing through the tree leaves in the night
#if theres also sounds of branches its more creepy and cool

"You gaze at the unsettling manor house looming before you. Thin spires reaching obliquely toward the sky, with tiles blackened as if burnt out by a fire."
"Even the gray stone of which the castle's exterior is made, it reminds one of an insane pallor, close to death."
"All around the manor, the diseased and leafless trees seem to bend in your direction, with irregular and sinister articulations of the branches, in what seems to be an expression of grief."
"You look around, and you realize-that you are engulfed in darkness. You see nothing behind you-but you hear the creaking of wood, the confused rustling of leaves, and more sounds you can't quite understand."
"A chill runs through your body. Where are the others? What has happened to them? There is no sign of them, and you begin to think that you should find shelter from the darkness."
"So you make your way to the entrance of the manor house."

#SOUND of big door creaking in opening
#BACKGROUND shift to "Entrance Hall", but no label jump.

"Nonostante le luci accese, la tua prima impressione è che questo luogo sia stato abbandonato a sé stesso."
"L'aria di questo luogo sembra più rarefatta- come una nebbia altamente improbabile. Potrebbe essere polvere, o cenere."
"Ti trovi in quello che sembrerebbe essere una grande entrance hall, con delle scale che portano verso l'alto."
"Una delle stanze al piano di sopra sembra aperta, forse uno studio di qualche genere."
"L'altra parte della scala, invece, porta direttamente all'attico."
"Questo piano sembra portare a un lungo corridoio, difficile sapere dove potrebbe farti finire."

#Choice: "Library" "Attic" "Corridor"

#if Library: jump to "Library"
#SOUND of woodboards creaking
"You stand in a dusty studio. The smell of old paper and ink fills your nostrils."
"In front of you stands a desk of fine wood, with wavy legs and a surface covered with a glass plate in which elegant decorations are carved."
"It is impossible to decipher the decorations, for the table is almost entirely taken up by tomes haphazardly stacked on top of each other, yellowed papers, fountain pens and ink nibs."
"The walls of the room are mostly taken up by ceiling-high bookcases with countless books and knick-knacks."
"You look around, and your attention is caught by an artifact that, of all things, seems strange to find in a study."
#SOUND of blade stroking against something, sharp sound
"It is a sword with rather ancient features, forged in a metal that seems alien to you and which, because of its color, you could perhaps trace back to copper."
"The sword must be of a ceremonial type, for it is studded with decorations on the hilt, the guard and the base of the blade itself."
"In particular, right there lies the figure of an ungodly creature you have never seen before. Its head is crowned with a ruby."
"Do you want to take the sword?"


#Choice: Yes / No
#If yes, maybe, add SOUND of item taken
#in both cases, the story goes on like this:

#SOUND of book dropped and fallen to the floor
"You walk back to the door, and in doing so you hear a thud. You accidentally dropped a book."
"When you pick it up to put it back, you notice that it is a smoke-gray tome with a leather cover where symbols are inscribed."
"They look like occult symbols going around a circle, and at the bottom is the title:"
"T'tka Halot."
#SOUND of pages shuffling
"You open it. The book contains a series of hand-made illustrations, so old that the ink, formerly black, has changed color along with the yellowing of the pages."
"You don't understand anything written in it, but they look like some sort of chants."
"Do you want to take the T'tka Halot?"


#Choice: Yes / No
#If yes, maybe, add sound of item taken
#in both cases, the story goes on like this:

#Choice: "Attic" or "Corridor"


#if Attic: jump to "Attic"


"As you climb the stairs leading to the attic, you realize that the lights do not reach the upper floor."
"You try to help yourself with the flashlight on your smartphone."

#if possible, EFFECT of flash

#SOUND of stairs creaking (maybe same sound as the woodboard)
"The stairs creak under your feet, lit by the sharp, bright light of the flashlight."
"They lead you to a short landing, and before you stands a door."
#SOUND of door handle creaking while opening
"You try to open it. The brass handle squeaks as it goes along with you."
" In front of you there is a dusty room, filled with junk that, in the cold light, seems to twist and extend into distorted shapes, merging with its own shadow..."
"... to the point that you are no longer sure where the silhouette of a wrapped Persian rug ends..."
"... and where the corner of an old curtain, set by the window, begins."
"There is no sign of your friends here. Nor of anything useful. But maybe you can find some information about what this manor is..."
"You look around. Old photographs, moldy books, mirrors covered with yellowed drapes."
"A fabric box, among other things, seems to contain a set of documents."
"Do you want to take a look?"

#Choice: Yes / No
#If yes, maybe, add sound of clue and:


#If no:
#Choice: "Library" or "Corridor"
